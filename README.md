# leg_bot v2

A newer, faster, better, more extensible version of leg_bot. Re-written from the ground up with ES6 (as much as I can, and as much as node.js supports).

## So what does it do?

Right now? Spits out a URL for a token, that will allow it to connect to TMI (Which it will do, and join it's own channel). Beyond that, not much at all. What can I say, it's early days, and I'm still working on this.

## What's the plan?

Well, I've got a kind of [roadmap](CodeMap.md) that I'm working with. Of course, it can all change at a moment's notice, but that's what I've got so far.

## What can I do?

Ideas, Pull Requests, all that kind of thing would be awesome. Support and interaction would be great. Donations would be nice too, both for this and the running of ghost_of_leg_bot. No pressure.
